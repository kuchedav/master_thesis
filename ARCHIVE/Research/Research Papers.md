# References from other papers
Remote sensing at regional and local scales has become an essential tool in wide areas. The classification of multi-spectral images has been a successful application that is used for classification of land cover maps (Lunetta and Balogh, 1999, Oettera et al. 2000, Yuan et al. 2005, ), urban growth (Yeh and Li, 1997, Zhang et al. 2002), forest change (Vogelmann and Rock, 1988, Hall et al. 1991, Coppin and Bauer, 1994), monitoring change in ecosystem condition (Lambin 1998, Weng 2002), monitoring assessing deforestation and burned forest areas (Potapov et al. 2008), agricultural expansion (Woodcock et al. 1993, Pax-Lenney et al. 1996), mapping corn (Maxwell et al. 2004), real time fire detection (Dennison and Roberts, 2009), estimating tornado damage areas (Myint et al. 2008), estimating water quality
